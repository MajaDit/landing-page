<strong><em>The F Word</strong> was designed to address gender inequalilty in music by 'providing a platform for female artists and practitioners to showcase their work and ability'. We have organised several events, some of which being <span>concerts run entirely by women</span> (from the line-up to the technicians and security) and holding a <span>music industry forum and networking event featuring an all-female panel</span>. Our events have been a great success and brought cosiderable attention to these issues.</em>
